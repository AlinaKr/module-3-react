- [The React Router documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/)


## [React | Installation](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html)

### With Codepen 
To use React, you can either play on Codepen with this [Hello World React example on Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010).


### With `create-react-app` 
Or you can create a React application with your terminal:

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```


## [React | Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

You can follow the tutorial, it will give you an overview.

It is doable if you don't have any React knowledge, but it is going to be hard.
